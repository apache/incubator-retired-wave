<!-- This file is embedded into a gwt_module.
     To use it, add a "deps" on
     //third_party/java_src/wave/java/org/waveprotocol/wave/client/common/util:useragents

     Note that we don't like opera, ie6 and ff2, but we don't restrict the user
     agent here, this will have to be done in the actually application. Compilation
     will likely fail altogether if one fail to do that (or setup a specific code path
     for those unsupported UAs that does not use our code) because of missing deferred
     binding rules.

     Notes about GWT's user.agent values:
      - ie6 is "ie6 or ie7" (or any upper IE version when running in compat' mode)
      - gecko1_8 is "gecko 1.8+", which includes all firefox versions starting with 1.5
      - safari is any webkit-based browser (including chrome and android)
